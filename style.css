px do not scale but em and rem scales.it is an absolute unit.Element (em) and Root element (rem) are responsive units interpreted into equivalent
px unit by the browser. They are relative units. Change in the value of the parent or root element affects the value of relative units. They scale with the device. 
Relative Length Unit:
em - Relative to the font-size of the element
% - Relative to the parent element
rem - Relative to the root element
vw - The viewport width is relative to 1% of the width viewport (browser window)
vh - The viewport height is relative to 1% of the height viewport (browser window)
vmin - The viewport minimum is relative to 1% of the viewport (browser window) for smaller dimension
vmax - The viewport maximum is relative to 1% of the viewport (browser window) for larger dimension

Rem is an absolute unit relative to the root element of the HTML document and is commonly used for font sizes. It is a scalable unit in which the browser renders into pixel values. 
I recommend it for responsiveness. The default root element font size is 16px.

Percentage(%)
The percentage unit is also relative to the parent element and is commonly used as the width and height of an element. 
Although there is no fixed rule on where to use this unit,it is rarely used for font sizes.
The percentage unit is also useful when creating a responsive layout.

The difference between percentage (%) and vw is just like the difference we encounter between rem and em. The Percentage unit is relative to the containing element 
while vw is relative to the viewport which is the browser window.
Here is an example of vw unit.A 5vh will lead to 5% of the current viewport height. 
This unit works just like the vw but with the height of a viewport, it is helpful when building a responsive website.
